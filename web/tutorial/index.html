            <h1> Categorized Scrolling Booklet of Data Boxes </h1>

            <h2> General Information </h2>
                <p> For my reusable component, I have made a scrolling booklet of data that allows the categorization of JSON objects by a specific attribute selected by the HTML coder. Additionally,
                the information shown on both the front and back of the boxes are chosen by the developer. Therefore, there is plenty of control for the person programming, allowing for a useful 
                reusable component. To use it, once must have four different input parameters: "jsonList", which is a list of JSON objects parsed to an array, "headingProperty", which is one of the
                attributes of the JSON object that is used for categorizing, "frontInfo", which is which elements a developer wants on the front of the card, and "backInfo", which is the attributes for
                the back of the card. When hovering over the cards, they have a flipping animation, and switch colors. When you click on of the headers, it will only show you the booklets that fall under
                that specific category. </p>

             <h2> Knowledge Required </h2>
             <p>In the following code example, it is the demonstration of using the scroll indicator. This is necessary to understand
             the reusable component, and requires for the HTML coder to understand how to call particular elements of their layout. 
             In this, we have the scroll indicator operating on an element, not just the window itself. Link:

             <p>In the following code example, there is a demonstration of how to change the text that occurs on a text box. This is a 
             key part of the program, as the flip boxes are populated with fields of the HTML coders choosing, and this helps to show
             how they are displayed. Link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GKFC483IPJLY">Populating Flip Box</a></p>
             
             <h2> Inspiration Pages </h2>
             <p>In this link, there is a tutorial on how to create a flip box. This is the main portion of 
             my component, since this holds the majority of the information being displayed. Link: <a target="_blank"

             <p>In this link, there is a tutorial on how to create a scroll indicator. This part of my component 
             is crucial to showing how two different categorized booklets perform on the same page. Link:

             <p>In this link, there is a tutorial on how to create a sticky nav-bar. This is an essential part of the JS
             code that I have written, because every time a header is clicked, it only shows the relevant booklets.

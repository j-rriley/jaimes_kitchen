                For the database table, I would like to create the recipe table as described above. The characteristics
                of a recipe entry should be the allergens, the author, type of recipe, ingredients, and the long description
                of how to create it.

                    <h4> Background in Web Design </h4>

            <p>
                This is my first time doing web design/development. I previously have taken an app design course, which also 
                used Java in an online space, so I am familiar with JSON and various mobile design elements that we have talked about,
                although I implemented them in Android Studio.

                        <h4> Homework 1: Home Page</h4>
            
            <p>
                The largest issue I've had with the homework is the clarity of certain instructions and also understanding expectations.
                I am building off of the lab, which I believe we were meant to do, but some of the instructions made me second-guess this.
                However, this is a valuable homework because it laid out the rest of the semester well and gives us good experience for
                a lot of what we were tested on in the Web Development Quiz. 
            </p>
    
                        <h4> Homework 2: JavaScript UI</h4>
            
            <p>
                For this homework, I found it to be very interesting but certain parts were definitely difficult.blog()
                My biggest issue was every time I got a new component to work, another part broke. Hence why I wasn't
                able to get the click anywhere portion of the HW to work. However I learned a lot about styling this
                lab because a lot more made sense.
            </p>
    
                        <h4> Homework 3a: JavaScript Component</h4>
    
            <p>            
                For this homework, I struggled a lot. For some reason, Netbeans was not properly executing AJAX no matter what
                code I used. I spend many hours debugging it, and I must have had the right answers multiple times without even knowing.
                I definitely learned so much about debugging this time around, and in addition to that, I had to learn extensively JavaScript and 
                HTML. However, it is quite frustrating that I am submitting this a day late due to my IDE.  
            </p>
    
                        <h4> Homework 3b: Database</h4>
    
            <p>            
                I enjoyed working with databases a lot. It was a pretty smooth homework assignment, where the only hiccups were short-lived 
                and were caused by simple errors. Working with databases is extremely straight-forward, especially on this homework where the 
                instructions were laid out very clearly. I was able to create and display the databases very easily. 
            </p>
    
            <p>    
                I found it valuable to start slow with databases and to have two to follow before creating our own. Setting up MySQL Workbench was
                also simple with the given instructions. To see my submission, click <a target="_blank" href='pics/Riley_database.docx'>here</a>. 
            </p>    

                        <h4> Homework 4: Data Display </h4>
               
            <p>
                This homework was not too difficult, and ultimately came down to piecing together different aspects of code and tweaking them when 
                required to do something new. I had extra time after completing the project, so decided to revamp the style of my website to be more
                attractive visually. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                In this lab, I feel that the basic concepts of web design clicked for me and I gained more of a grasp on all the knowledge we have learnt
                thus far, hence why I styled my webpage in a new way. I learned more about integrating different function into pre-existing JavaScript code.
            </p> 
    
			<h4> Tutorial Proposal </h4>
            
            <p>
		The most difficult part of this assignment was making sure that the idea was original enough and did not take any of the concepts that others
		have chosen. Also, figuring out how to style the different components to look the way I intended was more difficult than I expected, but taught me
		a lot about different CSS aspects. <a target="_blank" href='tutorial/poc.html'>Here is my proof of concept</a> and <a target="_blank" href='tutorial/proposal.pdf'>
		here is my proposal.</a>
            </p>
        
                    <h4>Homework 5: Web API Homework</h4> 

            <p>
		For this homework, most of what we had to do was accomplished by the lab and the sample code. Therefore it was not one of the more difficult assignments, and instead
                the struggles came more from keeping track of different components and making sure that all of our previous code also worked. I also think that debugging code in web 
                design can be difficult, because even with console cues, if code breaks for some reason it can end in a game of guess and check to try to see what went wrong, which I
                have found to be one of the most challenging parts of our homework. My <a target="_blank" href='pics/WebAPIErrors.pdf'>error checking worksheet</a> is linked there, and 
                here are the links to my two web APIs that were finished this week, which are 
                <a target="_blank" href='webAPIs/listUsersAPI.jsp'>live users</a> and my <a target="_blank" href='webAPIs/listOtherAPI.jsp'>live recipes.</a>
                As for the server side coding, the most that I had to do this week was adjust the SQL calls and the data being pulled from such.
            </p>
    
                    <h4> Homework 6: Log On Homework </h4>
    
             <p>
                 This homework was not particularly difficult, just because our two labs nicely broke up the work that was required. For instance, we started off having our WebAPIs written
                 from lab 06b, and therefore we just needed to create a User Interface that utilized these APIs. Additionally, the homework write up made what was required from us very clear, with just 
                 needing to make ajax calls for each of the functions to the web APIs, and providing the containers and functions that would make our log in interface successful. Of all things, I did
                 initially struggle with understanding where to start, but once this was understood, it was easy to more forward. For links to the web APIs:

                 </ul>
            </p>
            <h4> Homework 7b: Tutorial Assignment </h4>
    
            <p>As for the tutorial assignment, there was a lot learned and a lot of difficulty in various parts. For the most part, it was easy to understand
            the goal of the project. Linking to the tutorial aspects via the homepage of the website, doing the demo page, and the index page, were easy parts of this 
            assignment. However, when working on the reusable components of this assignment, it was difficult to figure out some of the JS code and styling. For me, there
            was difficult when creating elements, since the methods attached would overwrite previous methods. It was also difficult to style to a point that was clean and
            easy to follow. I learned a lot doing this though.</p>
            
            <h4> Homework 8: Update </h4>
            <p>This homework was definitely the most difficult for me thus far. I found myself having a hard time trying again after my first session of attempting a solution, 
            which is why this is being turned in late. What was the most difficult was interpreting the given sample code, since there were many aspects we had not seen before. 
            More than this, I had to work on many different files during this process, including many API's and Javascript files. Keeping track of them was a task in itself, but 
            there was a lot of value in this Javascript code and this really made the use of API's concrete for me.</p>
            
        
            <h4> Homework 9: Delete</h4>
            <p>This homework made me feel so much better about web design! After going through and fixing my update homework from before, I was able to understand the interconnectivity of
            all the pieces of APIs, our database, and JS code much more than before. It did not take me nearly as long as the other homeworks have, and it was pretty straightforward to implement. 
            I fixed my database design and plan to be fixing other pieces now that I understand more, especially with the final project being due shortly. I think this was a very important assigment
            for me to do.</p>
